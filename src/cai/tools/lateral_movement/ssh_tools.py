Lateral movement tools
======================

These helpers facilitate lateral movement within a network by
executing commands on remote hosts or testing connectivity.  They
are thin wrappers around standard UNIX utilities such as ``ssh``
and ``ping``.  An AI agent can call these functions to pivot from
one machine to another or to probe network reachability.

    client will inherit your current SSH configuration for other
